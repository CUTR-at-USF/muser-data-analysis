# muser-data-app
This is a Python Flask web app that currently offers the below functionalities:
* The app is now able to extract data from Spotify API, save a raw CSV file with the timestamp, and perform ETL operation to dump the extracted data in SQL Server table.
* In addition to the data extraction functionality, we have incorporated functionality to build a doc2vec NLP model and train it on the data dumped in the SQL table.
* There is one final functionality to expand the muser data, collected from FireBase, with metadata information collected from Spotify. The app first queries Spotify for an exact match with the muser record (artist, track, and album), and in case there is no exact match, the app utilizes the doc2vec model to predict the most similar match in the SQL table.
